  \page client_apis Sparta Client APIs

  These aspects of sparta allow inspection and interaction with a sparta-enabled simulator by an outside
  C++ entity. In general, any entity in the device tree can be located given a pointer to the root of
  the tree. Nodes can then be dynamically cast to the appropriate class (e.g. counter, parameter,
  register, etc.)
